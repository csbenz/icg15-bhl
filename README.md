## Building
Just do `mkdir build && cd build/` and just do `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..` for building.

Make sure if there is troubles to `make clean` before complaining about some weird effects.

## Debugging
* Either use `qtcreator` with their interface.
* You can use `cgdb` if you like more the command line.
* If you have the longest beard, feel free to use `gdb`.
* I've also heard about a tool named `ddd`, I haven't tested it though.
